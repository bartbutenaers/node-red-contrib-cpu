    <p>A node to monitor CPU usage.</p>
    <p>The CPU usage will be calculated for each core individually.  Such a CPU core usage is in fact the average usage since the previous calculation.  Therefore the value will become more accurate when it is calculated more frequently (e.g. when a trigger message is put on the input port every second)!</p>
    <p>For every core a separate output message will be created, which contains the following properties:
    <ul>
        <li><code>payload</code> is the core usage (as a percentage)</li>
        <li><code>speed</code> is processor speed (in MHz)</li>
        <li><code>topic</code> is the name of the (logical) CPU core (<i>core_xxx</i>)</li>
        <li><code>model</code> is the CPU model</li>
    </ul></p>
